Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This tutorial describes how to install a TeamSpeak server on your VPS ((I recommend Contabo's VPS))

The tutorial was Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24 using Teamspeak-Server Version 3.13.7!

The tutorial uses the example IP 127.0.0.1
This hostname must be replaced by the name of your own server if you follow the workflow described in this tutorial.
We will also use the domain sirabi.online in this course. Replace this with your own domain.
